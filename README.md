###Oracle JET Course

Some new content here

Small samples that, step-by-step, build up a thorough
understanding of the concepts underpinning Oracle JET.

some more addtl changes after staging

The samples will each form the basis of a chapter or exercise
in a book and/or course and/or a MOOC on Oracle JET.

The idea is to start from scratch, without any libraries,
then include Require.js, then Knockout.js, then Require Text, etc,
eventually replacing everything with Oracle JET.

By the end, the participant should have all the knowledge they need
to build applications with Oracle JET and know where to go
and how to solve problems/questions they may encounter.

The intended audience is anyone with basic JavaScript knowledge
who wants to create enterprise/business JavaScript applications
for the browser on the desktop and/or mobile devices.

Each part can take from 5 to 10 minutes to explain/do for, e.g., a MOOC.
